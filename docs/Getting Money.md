# Getting Money

This is an easy guide to help you get money so you can get rich!

## Work

Working is an hourly command that simulates an experience system that gives you better jobs. If you fail to work daily, you will end up getting fired from your job! The more you work, the more experience(EXP) you get. The more EXP you get, the better jobs you get. The better jobs you get, the more money you get. When you run the ***work*** command, you will be given one task that you have to complete to get paid. Running the ***work get*** command will show you a list of jobs featured in Acoustic Economy. The ID system is used to get a job.

> List of Jobs: ~work view **page**

> Get a job: ~work get **ID**

> Work: ~work

## Trivia and WikiHow

Trivia displays a random question, which you have to answer in 10 seconds.

WikiHow will give you a random WikiHow thumbnail, and you have to guess the according title in 15 seconds(warning: you can get some weird prompts).

> ~wikihow

## Hunting And Fishing

Hunting and fishing are essentially the same. In the shop, you buy a hunting rifle(ammo), or a fishing rod(fish bait). You then run the ***hunt*** or ***fish*** command, and you will get a random amount of money. Warning, your rifle/fishing rod can break, you may end up with nothing, or your car breaks down and you have to pay a fee to get it fixed. Each time, it will consume ammo or bait. You need ammo to hunt and bait to fish.

## Camera

The camera is easy. Run the ***camera*** command and wait a random amount of time. Stand by to type. Eventually, a popup will appear, and you will have to type "click", "shoot", or "shutter". The picture you get will give you a random amount of money.

## Mining

This is an upgrade in *bases.* When you run the ***mine*** command, you will see 3 numbers. One of which has the money behind them. Type the according to number to possibly receive your money. You have unlimited tries.

> ~mine

## Gambling

This is a risky one. You chose one of the commands listed below, and bet an amount of money. You will either gain the amount you bet, or you lose it.

- **Gamble**: You and a bot both get randomly generated numbers, the higher one wins.
- **Coinflip**: Pick *heads* or *tails.* The following message will decide your fate.
- **Blackjack**: [Official Tutorial](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/)

## Misc

Postmeme is a pretty interesting command. Run the ***postmeme*** command, and you pick one of four categories. You will get a random amount of money depending on the popularity of the meme.

When you run the ***search*** command, you pick one of three objects to search for money.

When you run the ***beg*** command, you're just begging for money. You will not get a lot of money.

Running the ***rob*** command will rob the user you choose. You have a 12-hour cooldown to rob, and the person you rob has a 12-hour cooldown to get robbed.
