Acoustic now has music nodes in Europe! ➜

<!--truncate-->

## Acoustic :heart: Europe

In our continued commitment to quality, we have installed another music node in Frankfurt, Germany.

This should improve the latency between music requests for everyone in Europe and Asia (dedicated nodes are coming to Asia in early 2022).

## Why we picked Frankfurt :round_pushpin:

Frankfurt is a strategic location in Europe as it is provides low-latency streaming to all of Spain, France, Belgium, and of course Germany.

As Acoustic grows, our users are more spread out across the globe, and we want them to have the same amazing experience as those in the States.
